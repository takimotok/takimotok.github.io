I am deeply passionate about personal growth and continuously challenging myself to develop new skills. This mindset of constant improvement guides many aspects of my life.

As a technology enthusiast, I enjoy customizing my development environment, particularly with Neovim. This interest in optimization extends to my daily routines, where I've developed a structured morning practice that includes early rising and running, helping me maintain peak performance throughout the day.

My appreciation for Japanese culture is reflected in my interests, from enjoying manga to experiencing the traditional healing practices of onsen (Japanese hot springs). These elements of Japanese culture have taught me the value of balance and mindfulness in modern life.

I take a holistic approach to wellness, carefully managing exercise, nutrition, sleep, and overall lifestyle balance. Rather than viewing these as separate elements, I see them as interconnected parts of a healthy, sustainable lifestyle.

I value meaningful connections and prefer intimate gatherings with small groups, whether for meals or social occasions. These moments provide opportunities for deeper conversations and genuine relationship building.
